        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a Computer Science student at Palawan State University, driven by a deep passion for both technology and sound. 
            My curiousity about sound acoustics has led me to explore the world of audio engineering.
            Iâ€™m fascinated by how computers process and translate analog signals into digital audio, opening up endless possibilities for sound manipulation. 
            My goal is to harness this computer technology to explore innovative ways of creating and refining audio, pushing the boundaries of what's possible through computing.</p>

            <h3>Track-Align Plug-in</h3>
            <p>This plugin is designed to seamlessly integrate with any Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). 
                It aligns the timing of one or more vocal and instrument tracks, ensuring perfect synchronization. 
                Additionally, it can match the pitch across similar tracks, enhancing the overall harmony of the mix. 
                The project is set to be implemented in C++, leveraging its efficiency and performance.</p>

            <h3>Room Reverb Analyzer</h3>
            <p>This application analyzes the reverb characteristics of a listener's room. 
                By using a ribbon microphone and measuring the room's height, length, and width, 
                it assesses how sound bounces within the space. 
                This analysis assists users in optimizing their room's acoustics for superior sound engineering and audio mixing. 
                The project will be developed in C++, ensuring robust performance and precision.</p>
